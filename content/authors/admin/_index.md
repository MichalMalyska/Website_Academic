I currently lead the "Science" (ML Science + ML Eng + ML Ops) team at Semantic Health, where we work on cool stuff in Clinical
Natural Language Processing. 
I also occasionally teach at University of Toronto (most recently [STA414/2104](https://duvenaud.github.io/sta414/)) where I completed both my degrees. 
Interested in all things machine learning, with a particular focus on good practices, and applications in high stakes environments (e.g. healthcare). 
Outside of work and school, I geek out on perma/agriculture, and the whole chain of food to metabolism, including growing (whatever you can in a condo), cooking, and burning the calories while running on Toronto waterfront trails.
