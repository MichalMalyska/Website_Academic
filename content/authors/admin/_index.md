I am a part-time MSc. student in Statistics at University of Toronto focusing on Machine
Learning. Currently working at a startup in the clinical ML space.
My current research revolves around Clinical NLP and improving training procedures
for Energy Based Models

Prior to starting my masters I completed my BSc. in Statistics,
also at University of Toronto and have worked at
[Deloitte's Actuarial Rewards & Analytics Team]
(https://www2.deloitte.com/ca/en/pages/audit/solutions/actuarial-rewards-analytics.html)
and Intact Financial's Belairdirect Team, where I utilized my quantitative background
to develop statistical models, and completed a large amount of high level work on the
state of analytics. While the vast majority of my work has been in the insurance
world I am not interested in pursuing that avenue further.

I will be posting the occasional projects on this website, but the bulk of my
academic work (especially relating to my teaching assistant appointments) can
be found on my other [website](https://michalmalyska.github.io).
